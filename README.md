each ipynb files are named after EE267_AnikaZaman> followed by the CNN architecture name>followed by parameter number

the paramters are the number of images like 5000, 10000, 15000 and 20000 images. Due to memory limit in Github, 5000 and 25000 images from denseNet 

and 25000 images from ResNet and ModelA CNN architecture implementations are shown

EE267_project_data_analysis_graph.ipynb is added separately and has all the analysis graphs done on  python
